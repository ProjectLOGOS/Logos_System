NAMING STANDARD (Canonical)

Rule:
- Each word capitalized: Title_Case
- Abbreviations fully capitalized (e.g., SMP, UIP, ARP, SCP, LEM)
- Words separated by underscores: Title_Case_With_Underscores
- Apply consistently to:
  - directories
  - python packages/modules (folder/module names)
  - protocol names
  - resource folders that participate in imports or runtime path resolution

Batch migration rule:
- Rename in small batches.
- Immediately rewrite imports and any filesystem path literals.
- Verify with:
  - import probe (START_LOGOS import)
  - short smoke run (START_LOGOS --no-ui --no-uip with timeout)

Fail-closed:
- If unresolved imports remain, stop and fix before proceeding.
