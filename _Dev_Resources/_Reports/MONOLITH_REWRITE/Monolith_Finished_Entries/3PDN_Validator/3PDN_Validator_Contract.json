  "description": "Validates alignment of incoming data or agent state against three core principles of divine necessity — Sign, Mind, and Bridge — each enforced through independently scoped filters. Applies a Mesh Holism check to ensure commutation across principles, performs Trinitarian Optimization to maximize coherence and lawful minimality, and seals the result using the Transcendental Locking Mechanism to produce a signed, cryptographically bound proof of alignment.",
