# Synthetic Cognition Protocol (SCP)

The Synthetic Cognition Protocol combines the Banach Data Node (BDN) system, Modal Vector Space (MVS) analysis, and creative cognition engines to extend LOGOS reasoning beyond deterministic logic. SCP supplies modal chain analyzers, fractal orbital models, and consciousness evaluation reports consumed by ARP, UIP, and SOP.

## Core Responsibilities
- Maintain MVS/BDN cognitive systems and expose status via the SCP nexus
- Execute modal chain processors (causal, epistemic, temporal, counterfactual, etc.)
- Generate fractal orbital analytics, dual bijection studies, and consciousness dashboards
- Support creative hypothesis generation and meta-reasoning workflows
- Persist convergence metrics, TODO hints, and enhancement recommendations for SOP

## Key Entry Points
- `system_utilities/nexus/scp_nexus.py`: Async nexus that brokers cognitive requests, modal chain processing, and fractal analysis services
- `BDN_System/`: Banach Data Node engines, persistence layers, and Trinity vector helpers powering belief-desire modeling
- `MVS_System/`: Modal Vector Space analyzers, fractal toolkits, visualization utilities, and dual bijection experiments
- `system_utilities/PROTOCOL_OPERATIONS.txt`: Canonical operations checklist used by orchestration scripts

## Operational Workflow
1. SOP/UIP agents authenticate with the SCP nexus to submit `CognitiveRequest` payloads
2. Nexus activates relevant cognitive systems (MVS, BDN, creative engine) and requested modal chains
3. Optional fractal analysis augments results with orbital metrics and c-value evolution
4. Results include enhancement recommendations, convergence status, and cross-protocol packets for ARP recursion

## Data Products & Logging
- Convergence traces in `system_utilities/nexus/scp_convergence.json`
- Fractal and consciousness study artifacts inside `MVS_System/`
- BDN genealogy and transformation audit trails within `BDN_System/core`

## Local Usage
```bash
cd external/Logos_AGI/Synthetic_Cognition_Protocol
python3 system_utilities/nexus/scp_nexus.py --help  # Nexus CLI entrypoint (async runners wrap this)
```
Protocol runners should follow SOP-issued tokens and honor passive mode expectations outlined in the operations checklist.
