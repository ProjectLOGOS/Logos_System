# LOGOS Renamed Protocol Architecture

## Overview

LOGOS operates with a specialized protocol architecture where each protocol has clearly defined responsibilities. This architecture provides better separation of concerns, security, and maintainability.

## Directory Structure

- `system_agent/` - System Agent for protocol coordination and control
- `User_Interaction_Protocol/` - Primary user interface and phase 0 input processing
- `Advanced_Reasoning_Protocol/` - Pure reasoning engines and analysis systems
- `Synthetic_Cognitive_Protocol/` - Advanced cognitive enhancement (MVS/BDN systems)
- `System_Operations_Protocol/` - Infrastructure, maintenance, governance, tokens
- `LOGOS_Agent/` - Planning, coordination, and linguistic processing
- `shared_resources/` - Cross-system utilities and common components

## Protocol Responsibilities

### Advanced_Reasoning_Protocol
- Pure reasoning engines (inference, logical, pattern, cognitive)
- Advanced analysis tools (complexity analysis, semantic analysis)
- Response synthesis and workflow orchestration
- **NO input processing or linguistic tools** (moved to other protocols)

### Synthetic_Cognitive_Protocol  
- Meta-Verification System (MVS) and Belief-Desire-Network (BDN)
- 8 types of modal logic chain processing
- Fractal orbital analysis and infinite reasoning capabilities
- Cognitive enhancement and optimization systems

### System_Operations_Protocol
- Infrastructure management and system operations
- Governance, auditing, testing, and validation systems
- Token management and authorization systems
- Logs, maintenance, health checks, and boot processes

### User_Interaction_Protocol
- Primary user interface gateway (web, API, command, GUI)
- Phase 0 input processing (sanitization, validation)
- User authentication and session management
- Response presentation and interface coordination

### LOGOS_Agent
- Causal planning and strategic coordination  
- Gap detection and goal decomposition
- Linguistic processing and NLP operations
- Resource allocation and task distribution

## Key Features

- **Single Agent Control**: Only System Agent manages all protocols
- **Token-Based Authorization**: SOP manages all system authorization
- **Gap-Driven Improvement**: Continuous system enhancement through TODO pipeline
- **Self-Improving Architecture**: SCP drives autonomous system improvements
- **Secure User Interface**: GUI layer prevents direct protocol access

## Getting Started

1. Run system initialization: `python system_agent/agent_controller.py`
2. Access GUI interface: `python gui_interface/user_interface.py`
3. Monitor system logs in `SOP/data_storage/system_logs/`

See `SINGLE_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed specifications.
