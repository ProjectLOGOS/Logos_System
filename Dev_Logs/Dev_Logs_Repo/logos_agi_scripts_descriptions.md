## Integration Notes

These scripts collectively implement the LOGOS_AGI's reasoning and cognition capabilities:

- **ARP** focuses on formal logical reasoning with privative, modal, and trinitarian logics
- **SCP** handles synthetic cognition through fractal mathematics, modal vector spaces, and consciousness modeling
- Both protocols integrate with the core LOGOS framework through coherence requirements and trinitarian logic principles
- Scripts use Python with heavy reliance on mathematical computations for logical and cognitive operations
