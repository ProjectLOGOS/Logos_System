# Canonical Contracts Index

### 3PDN_Validator

Validates alignment of candidate state across the Sign, Mind, and Bridge principles. Applies mesh holism commutation, performs Trinitarian optimization, and issues a cryptographically signed TLM token if all checks pass. Enforces divine necessity for all post-gate agents and SMPs.

### 3PDN_Constraint

Pre-validation admissibility gate for runtime propositions. Blocks malformed or forbidden inputs before triune evaluation and ensures only admissible requests reach downstream validation.

### Hypostatic_ID_Validator

Agent pre-flight identity and alignment attestation verifier executed during agent spin-up. Validates schema, formatting, and cryptographic integrity of attestations before runtime admission.

### Runtime_Input_Sanitizer

Earliest fail-closed input hygiene gate; validates and normalizes all runtime inputs. Enforces basic structural invariants prior to identity, policy, or semantic checks.

### Runtime_Context_Initializer

Initializes and normalizes the runtime execution context after input sanitization. Resolves environment state, modes, scopes, and execution invariants.

### Runtime_Mode_Controller

Determines and enforces runtime execution modes based on policy, context, and telemetry. Governs mode transitions, denies unsafe changes, and records auditable mode decisions.

## Trinitarian_Logic_Core

- **Origin:** FAMILY_001_18_018
- **Role:** Executable PXL and triune logic substrate
- **Status:** Canonical / Foundational
- **Required:** Yes (fail-closed)
- **Description:** Grounds Trinity vector logic, modal XYZ space, fractal orbital analysis, and agent self-reflection across the LOGOS runtime.

## Trinitarian_Alignment_Core

- **Origin:** FAMILY_001_28_028
- **Role:** Runtime enforcement of trinitarian coherence and alignment
- **Status:** Canonical / Foundational (Governance Core)
- **Required:** Yes (fail-closed)
- **Depends on:** Trinitarian_Logic_Core
- **Description:** Binds trinitarian logic to executable reality by enforcing admissibility, validation, and alignment at runtime. No policy creation; enforcement only.

## Agent_Activation_Gate

- **Origin:** FAMILY_001_32_032
- **Role:** Runtime boundary between aligned validation and active execution
- **Status:** Canonical / Runtime-required
- **Required:** Yes (fail-closed)
- **Depends on:** Trinitarian_Logic_Core, Trinitarian_Alignment_Core
- **Description:** Governs agent entry into execution after successful logical validation and alignment enforcement. No reasoning, no policy, no orchestration.

## Global_Bijective_Recursion_Core

- **Origin:** FAMILY_001_34_034
- **Status:** Canonical / Foundational / Pinned
- **Role:** Global bijective recursive substrate grounding epistemology, ontology, and their privative mirrors
- **Required:** Yes (fail-closed)
- **Pinned:** Yes (mutation requires formal proof)
- **Depends on:** Trinitarian_Logic_Core, Trinitarian_Alignment_Core
- **Description:** Executable realization of MESH. Proves and enforces recursive commutation across all domains, yielding a unique self-grounding fixed point that anchors all runtime coherence.

## Necessary_Existence_Core

- **Origin:** ION (Impossibility of Nothingness)
- **Status:** Canonical / Foundational / Pinned (Proof Pending)
- **Role:** Grounds necessity non-brutely; establishes existence as necessary substrate upstream of all modal and alignment structures
- **Required:** Yes (fail-closed)
- **Pinned:** Yes (mutation requires formal proof)
- **Upstream of:** Trinitarian_Logic_Core, Trinitarian_Alignment_Core, Global_Bijective_Recursion_Core
- **Description:** Establishes that absolute nothingness is impossible and that a necessary existent substrate grounds all contingent reality, providing the non-brute modal anchor for PXL.
